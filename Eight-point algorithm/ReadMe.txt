* In this program, the vl_sift() function from the vl_feat library for MATLAB
* The program is broken down to several smaller functions for modularity and convenience.
* The main code of the eight-point algorithm is contained in the eightPoint.m file
* This question has 3 subproblems. The code for the three subproblems can be tested by running the MATLAB scripts ques1.m, ques2.m and ques3.m

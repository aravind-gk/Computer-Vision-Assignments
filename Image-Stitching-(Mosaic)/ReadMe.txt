* The MATLAB code is contained in two files: merge.m and driver.m 
* merge.m contains the code for merging any two input images and returning a mosaic image as output. Note that merge.m is a MATLAB function and not a MATLAB script.
* driver.m is the main driver code which has two sections for two image datasets (one dataset given in the question and other dataset created by me)
* run the driver.m MATLAB code, one section at a time, to get output mosaic displayed for each dataset.
* I used the standard library from vlfeat.org in these Matlab programs. It can be installed by downloading the binary package from vlfeat.org, then extracting the zip file, then navigating to the toolbox folder of vlfeat, and run the vl_setup.m file from MATLAB command line. 

* The images of given dataset are stored as "image01.jpg", "image02.jpg", ... , "image05.jpg" (from leftmost image to rightmost image)

* The images of the custom dataset created by me, are stored in the same folder with filenames "im01.jpeg", "im02.jpeg", ... , "im05.jpeg" (from leftmost image to rightmost image)

* The output images for each dataset (both with and without performing blending) are also stored in the same folder with appropriate file names. 

* The Report for the assignment is also stored in the same folder as "G_Aravind_18132_HW2.pdf" in PDF format.

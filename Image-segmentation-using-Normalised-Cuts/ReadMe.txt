* The code for segmentation is given in the file IMGSEG.m in the form of a MATLAB function. 
* To run the function, run the 'ncut.m' file with any input image filename of your choice. Make sure that the image is also in the same folder.
* The 'ncut.m' file internally calls the IMGSEG.m file. 
* This Q1 folder also contains some sample images which I used to test my code. Feel free to use those images for testing the code.
* This program implements the normalised cuts algorithm from scratch, so no external packages are required to be installed in order to run this program.
